# Description
The core objective is to develop a functional online store that showcases products and allows users to interact with them. This involves both frontend and backend development.

For the frontend, participants are expected to use standard web technologies:

HTML for structuring the web pages.

CSS for styling and ensuring a visually appealing layout.

JavaScript for interactive elements and client-side logic.

On the backend, interns have a choice of frameworks:

Django (Python-based)

Express.js (Node.js-based)

Beyond the basic product listings, several key features must be implemented to create a comprehensive e-commerce experience:

Shopping Cart: A fundamental component that allows users to add multiple products, view their selected items, and manage quantities before proceeding to purchase.

Product Details Page: A dedicated page for each product, displaying detailed information such as a more extensive description, larger images, price, and potentially stock availability.

Order Processing: This involves the backend logic for handling a user's purchase, including recording the order, updating inventory, and managing the order status.

User Registration/Login: A system that enables users to create accounts, log in, and manage their sessions, which is crucial for personalized shopping experiences and order tracking.

Finally, a database is essential for storing all the necessary information, including:

Products: Details about each item available for sale.

Users: Information about registered customers.

Orders: Records of all purchases made on the site.

This task aims to provide hands-on experience in building a complete full-stack application, covering aspects from user interface design to data persistence and core e-commerce functionalities.
